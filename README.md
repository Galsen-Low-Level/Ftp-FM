# Ftp-FM 


Serve as a fast local http server and FTP utility.  
You can also use it to browse files like File Manager but in the Navigator. 

Quite simple to use. Type the `--help` flag to get the usage summary. 

NOTE: By default, if the target directory contains an `.html` or `.htm` index, priority is given to displaying these files.
